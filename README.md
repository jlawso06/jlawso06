My name is Jordan Lawson and I'm a soon-to-be a Universty of Washington Bothell Graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Software Engineering. <br /><br />
I'm interested in the many fascets of Game Development, I'm hoping to get into the Video Game Industry through QA Testing or other Entry Level positions <br /><br />
I'm currently a TA for CSS385 Intro to Game Development so I can see how Students make use of the 100 Mechanics for Programmers project that I was part of and pass
 along any suggestions or issues to Students currently working on the project. <br /><br />
My GitHub at the moment is quite a mess, I'm looking into fixing it up to function as a portfolio for my work.<br /><br />
I can be reached on my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-lawson-812829149/)
